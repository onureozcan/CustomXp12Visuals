# CustomXp12Visuals

My custom script to increase visuals on XP 12

 - Better reflections and lighthing
 - Smaller rain drop sizes
 - Stronger shadows, creating more contrast
 - Better cloud shapes and colors
 - Reduced dark cockpit effect

 You need fly with lua. Simply drop this script to the Scripts folder

 Note: tested only by myself on 12.09. I cannot guarantee it will work flawlessly. There may be bugs, artifacts, fps drops. Use at your own responsibility

 Better here is subjective. Check out the screenshots and see for yourself!
